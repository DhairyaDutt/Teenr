                <h3>Power Mentoring Program</h3>
                <p> 
                    <b>A short-term mentoring program to help you become the best version of who you are and find the most suitable career fit.</b> 
                    <br> 
                    Our mentors urge you to think of success from a new perspective and begin working towards your evolving career path goals.  We initiate a new awareness about who you are and consciousness about your strengths. A series of assessments and assignments lead you through the path of informed decision making. 
                    Prepare yourself for the jobs of the future while defining your personal vision and growth. Often this program is the beginning of a long association with us for most of our mentees.

                    <p> 
                        <b>We have managed to present the key benefits of our career mentoring programs in a power packed version for you - a boot camp.</b>   
                        <br>
                        The first step towards making a career choice is career awareness and knowledge about the self. Our camps enable this awareness almost instantaneously and present the career opportunities effectively to you. You can gain the big picture view and relevance of pursuing suitable paths in a meaningful manner through this.
                         The impact of our career camps is very impressive/rewarding with a significant number of teens acknowledging that it has inculcated a profound sense of direction for their future.
