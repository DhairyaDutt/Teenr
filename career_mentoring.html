                <p> 
                    <b>A short-term mentoring program to help you become the best version of who you are and find the most suitable career fit.</b>  
                    Our mentors urge you to think of success from a new perspective and begin working towards your evolving career path goals.  We initiate a new awareness about who you are and consciousness about your strengths. A series of assessments and assignments lead you through the path of informed decision making. 
                    Prepare yourself for the jobs of the future while defining your personal vision and growth. Often this program is the beginning of a long association with us for most of our mentees.
